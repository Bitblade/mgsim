.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The SMC is a helper device that provides IO Network enumeration.
An I/O device of this type can be specified in MGSim using the device
type \fBSMC\fP\&.
.SH PROTOCOL
.sp
After system start\-up, the SMC serves as an enumerator for the I/O
interconnect where it is attached: explicit \fII/O read\fP requests will
be answered with information about what devices are attached.
.sp
The enumeration data is composed of 8\-byte packets.
.sp
The first 8 bytes indicate how many clients are attached to the I/O
interconnect.
.sp
Subsequent packates of 8 bytes enumerate the devices. For now, only
bytes 2\-3 are used in each packet, and indicate the device type. Which
identifier correspond to which device type is given by the command
\fBshow devicedb\fP at MGSim\(aqs interactive prompt (\fB\-i\fP).
.SH INTERFACE
.sp
The SMC device presents itself to the I/O bus as a single read\-only
device. It can be accessed using any data size.

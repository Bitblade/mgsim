Process: Write to memory
================
- MemoryStage oncycle
	- Needs to activate? YES
	- WRITE, so input latch has FULL register.
		(RegState{RST_: INVALID, EMPTY, WAITING, PENDING, FULL})
	- Breakpoint
	- Get (Serialised) byte value of input
	> Test IOMatchUnit::IsRegisteredWriteAddress
	>	Search map object for addr in range. map entries: {MemSize, AccessMode{R,W,RW}, MMIOComponent*}
	
    > IOMatchUnit::Write
    >   Search map object again
    >   Calculate base, offset
    >   [MMIOComponent]::Write(offset, data, size, fid, tid)
    > 		Simulator::drisc::MMUInterface::Write(...)
    > 			Test if offset = integer aligned
    ? 			WHAT THE HECK!? It's doing some virtual memory stuff using hints
    ?			Hints are comming from the pipeline. Execute stage is using the same
    ?			hints as "cmd"
